Cities are faced with more issues in managing 
traffic congestion, maintaining road safety, and effectively 
responding to events as urbanization picks up speed and vehicle 
traffic increases. In order to solve these issues, this research 
presents an Intelligent Traffic Management System that 
optimizes traffic flow and improves urban mobility by 
integrating cutting-edge technology. The system uses Python for 
backend processing, Roboflow for reliable data model training, 
and YOLO v8 for accurate real-time object identification. The 
frontend is built with React and MySQL for effective data 
administration. The four main features of the Intelligent Traffic 
Management System are as follows: (1) Vehicle Detection and 
Traffic Optimization which monitors and controls traffic density 
at intersections dynamically using YOLO v8, (2) Pedestrian 
Detection and Safety which ensures safe crossings through real- 
time tracking and adaptive signal control, (3) Accident Detection 
and Notification which uses video analytics to quickly identify 
and report incidents and enable timely emergency response and 
(4) Traffic Violation Detection, which enables automated 
identification and reporting of traffic infractions like speeding 
and illegal parking. The Intelligent Traffic Management System 
provides a comprehensive solution that greatly improves traffic 
flow, lowers congestion, increases road safety, and makes quick 
incident management possible in contemporary urban 
environments by combining various functionalities into a 
coherent and scalable framework.
